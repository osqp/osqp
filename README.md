The OSQP (Operator Splitting Quadratic Program) solver is a numerical optimization package for solving problems in the form
```
minimize        0.5 x' P x + q' x

subject to      l <= A x <= u
```

where `x in R^n` is the optimization variable. The objective function is defined by a positive semidefinite matrix `P in S^n_+` and vector `q in R^n`. The linear constraints are defined by matrix `A in R^{m x n}` and vectors `l` and `u` so that `l_i in R U {-inf}` and `u_i in R U {+inf}` for all `i in 1,...,m`.
