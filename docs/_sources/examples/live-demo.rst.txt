Live Demo
=========

OSQP is available on `Pyodide <https://pyodide.org/>`_, a tool that runs Python entirely in your web browser
using *WebAssembly*, a technology that lets code run at near-native speed inside the browser. This means you can start
using OSQP without having to install anything, not even Python!

Visit `<https://osqp.org/wasm>`_ to see OSQP in action with a live demo. ðŸš€

This URL runs a `Marimo <https://marimo.io>`_ notebook, which is very similar to a Jupyter notebook. You can add/edit
cells, and use OSQP along with :code:`numpy`, :code:`scipy`, and many other libraries.

See :ref:`Examples <examples>` on how to start using OSQP.
