Build from sources
==================

Install GCC and CMake
----------------------

The main compilation directives are specified using

- `GCC compiler <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ to build the binaries
- `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ to create the Makefiles


Linux
^^^^^
Both :code:`gcc` and :code:`cmake` commands are already installed by default.

Mac OS
^^^^^^

Install Xcode and command line tools
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

#. Install the latest release of `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/download/>`_.

#. Install the command line tools by executing from the terminal

    .. code:: bash

        xcode-select --install

Install CMake via Homebrew
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

#. Install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ and update its packages to the latest version.

#. Install cmake by executing

    .. code:: bash

        brew install cmake


Windows
^^^^^^^

#. Install `TDM-GCC <http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download>`_ 32bit or 64bit depending on your platform.

#. Install the latest binaries of `CMake <https://cmake.org/download/#latest>`__.


Build the binaries
------------------

Run the following commands from the terminal

#. You first need to get the sources from one of these two options:

    * Download the compressed source file from the latest OSQP release `at GitHub <https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases>`_.

    * Clone the repository

        .. code:: bash

            git clone https://github.com/osqp/osqp

#. Create :code:`build` directory and change directory

        .. code:: bash

            cd osqp
            mkdir build
            cd build

#. Create Makefiles

    - In Linux and Mac OS run

        .. code:: bash

            cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..

    - In Windows run

        .. code:: bash

            cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..


#. Compile OSQP

    .. code:: bash

       cmake --build .


Thanks to CMake, it is possible to create projects for a wide variety of IDEs; see `here <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html>`_ for more details. For example, to create a project for Visual Studio 17 2022, it is just necessary to run

.. code:: bash

   cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..

To generate unittests for OSQP, specify the `-DOSQP_BUILD_UNITTESTS=ON` flag. This requires that you have `numpy` and `scipy` python modules, so it is best to do this in a python virtual environment where you have these packages installed.

.. code:: bash

   cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DOSQP_BUILD_UNITTESTS=ON ..

The compilation will generate the demo :code:`osqp_demo` (and the unittests :code:`osqp_tester` if you generated them) executable. In the case of :code:`Unix Makefiles` or :code:`MinGW Makefiles` option they are located in the :code:`build/out/` directory.  Run them to check that the compilation was correct.

Once the sources are built, the generated static :code:`build/out/libosqpstatic.a` and shared :code:`build/out/libosqp.ext` (where :code:`ext` is :code:`.so/.dylib/.dll` depending on your platform) libraries can be used to interface any C/C++ software to OSQP (see :ref:`install_osqp_libs` installation).

.. _install_the_binaries:

Install the binaries
--------------------

To install the generated libraries and headers to a system-wide location compatible with `GNU standards <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html>`_ it is just necessary to run

.. code:: bash

   cmake --build . --target install

This code installs the libraries in :code:`libdir` and the headers into :code:`includedir/osqp`. For mode details see the defaults folders on the `GNU standards <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html>`_ website.
To change the installation prefix, in the "Create Makefiles" step above, you need to specify the destination folder as :code:`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=myfolder ..`.

.. note:: This step requires write permissions in the destination
	  folders. You might be able to gain access using the
	  :code:`sudo` command.

We provided also an uninstall routine to remove the copied files by running

.. code:: bash

   cmake --build . --target uninstall

Note that this corresponds to running :code:`make install` and :code:`make uninstall` on unix machines.
